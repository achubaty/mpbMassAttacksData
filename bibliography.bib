    abstract = {The current landscape in western Canada includes an abundance of older pine stands that have matured without any active silviculture and are consequently very susceptible to mountain pine beetle outbreaks. The key to avoiding future damage is to focus longterm management of pine forests on relieving the conditions that facilitate landscapelevel outbreaks. We present an overview of this management concept in three parts: a) landscape-level management of existing pine forests to reduce susceptibility to the development of epidemic outbreaks; b) stand-level management of future pine forests to reduce susceptibility to infestation; and, c) preliminary results of recent research examining the effi cacy of spacing mature stands to prevent development of incipient outbreaks.},
