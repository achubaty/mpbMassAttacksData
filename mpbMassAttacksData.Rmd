### `mpbMassAttacksData`

This module imports the raw MPB red-top attack data from AB and BC over several years (2001-2016), following the methodology of @Cooke:2017fem.
MPB attack data for AB (derived from spatial points) and BC (derived from spatial polygons) were reprojected to use an Albers equal-area conic projection and rasterized using a common resolution of 250 m x 250 m (matching the pine raster data) and merged into a single raster layer for each year.
BC raster cell were calculated from the proportion of a polygon within that cell, again assuming an average stem density of 1125 stems/ha [per @Whitehead:2004rz].
Raster cells for AB were calculated by summing the point values within each 6.25 ha raster cell.
Where possible, all data downloads and preprocessing were scripted for reproducibility from raw, original sources.

Because of the long processing time and high memory requirements of the GIS operations performed during data preprocessing, with use a combination of caching approaches – implemented in the `reproducible` R package [@McIntire:2018reproducible] – to speed up subsequent loading and use of these data.
All preprocessed data are made available in a private Google Drive folder, and subsequently downloaded from there when used by a `SpaDES` module.
